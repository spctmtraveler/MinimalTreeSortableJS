# DUN Task Management System

## Overview

DUN is a hierarchical task management application built with a client-server architecture. The frontend provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for organizing tasks in a tree structure, while the backend handles data persistence using PostgreSQL. The application focuses on task organization with priority flags, scheduling, and filtering capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **UI Pattern**: Single-page application with modal-based task editing
- **Drag-and-Drop**: SortableJS library for intuitive task reordering
- **Styling**: Dark theme with Inter font, responsive design optimized for mobile
- **State Management**: Client-side task tree with immediate persistence to backend

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for task CRUD operations
- **Data Flow**: Immediate persistence - every user action triggers a database save

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Vanilla JavaScript Frontend**
   - Problem: Need lightweight, fast-loading task management interface
   - Solution: Pure JavaScript without framework overhead
   - Pros: Fast load times, no build process, simple debugging
   - Cons: More manual DOM manipulation, less structured than framework approach

2. **Immediate Persistence Strategy**
   - Problem: Prevent data loss during task manipulation
   - Solution: Every action (create, edit, reorder, toggle) immediately saves to database
   - Pros: No data loss, always synchronized
   - Cons: Higher database load, potential performance impact with many rapid changes

3. **Hierarchical Task Structure**
   - Problem: Complex task organization needs
   - Solution: Parent-child relationships with sections and nested tasks
   - Pros: Flexible organization, supports project breakdown
   - Cons: Complex tree management logic

## Key Components

### Task Management
- **Task Creation**: New tasks automatically placed in TRIAGE section
- **Task Editing**: Modal-based editor with rich metadata fields
- **Task Organization**: Drag-and-drop reordering with parent-child relationships
- **Priority System**: Five priority flags (Fire, Fast, Flow, Fear, First)
- **Scheduling**: Date-based scheduling with time estimates

### Data Structure
- **Tasks Table**: Core task storage with hierarchical relationships
- **Fields**: Content, completion status, parent relationships, priority flags, scheduling data
- **Tree Building**: Server-side conversion from flat database structure to nested tree

### User Interface
- **Top Banner**: Fixed header with task input, filtering, and view controls
- **Task Tree**: Collapsible hierarchical display with drag-and-drop
- **Modal Editor**: Detailed task editing interface
- **Filtering**: Multiple filter options (Today, Tomorrow, This Week, etc.)

## Data Flow

1. **Application Load**: Frontend requests all tasks from `/api/tasks`
2. **Server Processing**: Database query returns flat task list, converted to nested tree
3. **Client Rendering**: JavaScript builds DOM tree with drag-and-drop capabilities
4. **User Actions**: Every modification triggers immediate API call to persist changes
5. **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately while background persistence occurs

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Libraries
- **SortableJS**: Drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI elements
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for typography

### Backend Dependencies
- **Express.js**: Web framework for API endpoints
- **pg (node-postgres)**: PostgreSQL client for database operations
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing middleware

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for task persistence
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Setup
- **Frontend**: Static files served by Express.js
- **Backend**: Node.js server with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL instance (local or hosted)
- **Environment**: Environment variables for database connection

### Production Considerations
- **Database URL**: Configured via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Port Configuration**: Configurable via `PORT` environment variable (default 5000)
- **Static Assets**: Served directly by Express for simplicity

## Recent Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features (June 28, 2025)
- **Core Task Management**: Hierarchical tree, drag-and-drop, CRUD operations
- **Priority System**: Five flags with tooltips, toggle visibility, sorting
- **Modal Data Persistence**: Fixed date/time/estimate storage and retrieval
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with immediate persistence
- **View Toggles**: All top banner icons now functional
- **Delete/Undo System**: 5-second undo with proper database restoration
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, Enter, Escape, Tab navigation
- **Completion Styling**: Accent color checkboxes, strikethrough text
- **Control Panel Timing**: 0.2s fade in, 1s fade out for hover states
- **Task Truncation**: 240px width limit with ellipsis and tooltips
- **Quick Add Logic**: Creates tasks in Triage with all defaults
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design with touch support

### üîç Key Business Logic (June 29, 2025)

#### Triage Filtering Rules
- **Expired Revisit Dates**: Tasks with revisit dates in the past that aren't completed
- **No Revisit Date**: Tasks with null/undefined revisit dates (need review)
- **Today's Tasks**: Tasks scheduled for today but not yet categorized to A/B/C
- **Physical Location**: Always shows tasks physically located in Triage section

#### Date Range Definitions
- **This Week**: Last Monday through coming Sunday (Monday-based week)
- **This Month**: 1st calendar day through last calendar day of current month
- **Next Week/Month**: Following the same pattern for future periods

### ‚ùå Advanced Features Not Yet Implemented
- Task search functionality
- Keyboard navigation shortcuts
- Bulk task operations
- Task archiving system
- Export/import capabilities
- Performance optimizations for large task lists

This file contains a serialized copy of the most important files in the "DUN Task Management" app. the beginning and end of every file is indicated. The intent is for you to identify significant errors in the code (must fixes - not "nice to fix" unless specifically asked for that). Typically there will be a specific bug you're asked to solve, in which case you are to focus on figuring out why that bug is happenening and give a clear explanation of the problem, how to fix it, and the exact code and placement of the code fix.

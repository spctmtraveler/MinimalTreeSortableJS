# AI Consultant Handoff - DUN Task Filter Bug

## Critical Issue Summary
**Date:** July 24, 2025, 4:47 PM  
**Status:** BROKEN - All date filters show zero tasks  
**Urgency:** HIGH - Core functionality completely broken  

## Problem Description
The date filtering system in the DUN task management application is completely broken. Users cannot filter tasks by "Today", "Tomorrow", "This Week", etc. Only "All" and "Triage" filters work.

## Test Data Analysis
The application uses structured test data with descriptive names that reveal expected behavior:

### Expected vs Actual Results
```
TODAY FILTER (July 24, 2025):
Expected to show:
‚úÖ "Today A 07a" - revisit_date: 2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z
‚úÖ "Today B 10a" - revisit_date: 2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z  
‚úÖ "Today C 04p" - revisit_date: 2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z
‚úÖ "PastDue T NA" - revisit_date: 2024-12-15T00:00:00.000Z (overdue)

Actual result: ZERO tasks shown

TOMORROW FILTER (July 25, 2025):
Expected to show:
‚úÖ "Tomorrow A 09a" - revisit_date: 2025-07-25T00:00:00.000Z

Actual result: ZERO tasks shown
```

## Technical Analysis

### Working Components
- ‚úÖ DOM queries: `document.querySelectorAll('.task-item')` finds ~23 elements
- ‚úÖ Date calculations: `today = July 24, 2025`, `tomorrow = July 25, 2025`
- ‚úÖ Data parsing: `taskData.revisitDate` correctly parsed as ISO strings
- ‚úÖ Filter detection: `filterValue` correctly set to "today", "tomorrow", etc.

### Broken Components
- ‚ùå Date matching execution: Logic exists but `shouldShow` never becomes true
- ‚ùå Boolean evaluation: `isToday || isOverdue` should be true but evaluates to false
- ‚ùå Result application: All tasks get `shouldShow = false`

### Current Logic (script.js lines ~1577-1587)
```javascript
case 'today':
  const isToday = taskDateOnly.getTime() === today.getTime();
  const isOverdue = taskDateOnly.getTime() < today.getTime() && !isCompleted;
  shouldShow = isToday || isOverdue;
  console.log(`üîç TODAY FILTER: isToday: ${isToday}, isOverdue: ${isOverdue}, shouldShow: ${shouldShow}`);
  break;
```

This logic appears correct but the boolean operations are not working as expected.

## Debug Infrastructure Added
- **Super-dump logging**: Triggers detailed output when task names suggest they should match a filter
- **Enhanced console logs**: Shows boolean calculation results
- **Flow tracing**: Tracks execution through the filter logic

## Investigation Questions
1. **Variable Scope**: Is `shouldShow` being reset somewhere after assignment?
2. **Boolean Logic**: Are `isToday` and `isOverdue` actually calculating correctly?
3. **Switch Execution**: Is the switch statement being reached at all?
4. **Date Comparison**: Are the `.getTime()` comparisons working properly?
5. **Conditional Logic**: Is there a condition preventing the switch statement execution?

## File Locations
- **Primary Logic**: `script.js` function `handleFilterChange()` lines ~1515-1650
- **Debug Pages**: 
  - `current-bug-report-july24.html` - Complete status report
  - `filter-flow-diagram.html` - Visual flow analysis  
  - `debug-files.html` - Source code aggregator
- **Test Interface**: `index.html` filter dropdown

## Business Logic Requirements
1. **Past Due Tasks**: Should appear in Triage AND current date filters (need immediate attention)
2. **Exact Matches**: Tasks scheduled for specific dates should appear in those filters
3. **Unscheduled Tasks**: Tasks without revisit dates should ONLY appear in Triage
4. **Completed Tasks**: Should not appear in any date filters

## Recommended Approach
1. **Add Aggressive Debugging**: Insert console.log statements throughout the switch statement
2. **Test Boolean Operations**: Manually verify `isToday` and `isOverdue` calculations
3. **Check Variable Persistence**: Ensure `shouldShow` assignments aren't being overwritten
4. **Trace Execution Flow**: Verify the switch statement cases are being reached
5. **Test with Single Task**: Focus on why "Today A 07a" doesn't show in Today filter

## Expected Outcome
After fixing, the console should show:
```
üîç TODAY FILTER: Task "Today A 07a" - isToday: true, isOverdue: false, shouldShow: true
‚úÖ SHOW: "Today A 07a" will be visible
üîç TODAY FILTER: Task "PastDue T NA" - isToday: false, isOverdue: true, shouldShow: true  
‚úÖ SHOW: "PastDue T NA" will be visible
üèÅ FILTER COMPLETE: 8 shown, 15 hidden
```

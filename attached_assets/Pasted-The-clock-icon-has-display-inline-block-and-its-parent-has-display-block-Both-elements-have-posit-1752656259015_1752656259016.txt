The clock icon has display: inline-block and its parent has display: block. Both elements have position: static.

Here are a few potential reasons why the clock icon is not positioned as you expect:

Inline-block Flow: display: inline-block elements are placed in the normal document flow, similar to text. The exact positioning will depend on the preceding elements and the available space within the parent container. Since its parent has display: block, the icon is likely being placed on a new line or influenced by the layout of the block-level parent.
Lack of Positioning: With position: static, the top, right, bottom, and left properties have no effect. To position the element relative to its normal position, its containing block, or the viewport, you would need to use a different position value (e.g., relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
Parent's Block Layout: The parent element is a block-level element with a defined width. How the inline-block child is positioned within this block depends on factors like the parent's text-align and any other content within the parent. Currently, the parent's text-align is start.
To achieve the desired positioning to the right of the "time-line-indicator" and potentially as the rightmost element, consider the following:

Flexbox or Grid on the Parent: If you want to control the layout of the "time-icon" container and its children more precisely, consider setting display: flex or display: grid on the parent .time-icon. This would allow you to use properties like justify-content and align-items to position the child elements.
Absolute Positioning: If you want to position the clock icon relative to its containing block (which is likely the nearest ancestor with a position value other than static), you could set position: absolute on the clock icon and then use top, right, bottom, and left to place it. Remember that for position: absolute to work relative to a specific ancestor, that ancestor needs a position value other than static (e.g., position: relative).
